# Space-Carving
Implementation of the space carving algorithm to create 3D shapes from a collection of 2D images taken from multiple points of view.

## Data

The [Multiview Datasets](https://vision.in.tum.de/data/datasets/3dreconstruction) provided by Technical University of Munich are used for this project.

**P.S.** Before implementing the algorithm, make sure to download the datasets and place them in a folder called "DataSets" in your Downloads directory.
